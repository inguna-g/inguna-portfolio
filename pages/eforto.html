        <p>
            For this EU-funded pilot, I designed the prototype for a clinical app aimed at helping seniors track grip strength ‚Äî an early health decline indicator. We aligned with medical constraints, adapted patterns from fitness and meditation apps, and usability-tested the Dutch-language prototype with seniors through guerilla testing, workshops, and in-person sessions.

                <h3 tabindex="0">Understanding Constraints & User Mental Models</h3>
                <p>
                    The project's foundation was provided by the client's detailed academic research, which precisely defined the medical test's type, sequence, required rest times, and other clinical parameters. My primary challenge was to translate these complex medical requirements into an intuitive and usable digital interface. I meticulously <strong>mapped the relationships and flow of the test protocol</strong>, simultaneously exploring parallels with existing, validated UI patterns from familiar applications, drawing inspiration from fitness trackers and meditation apps to create an experience that felt both medically rigorous and user-friendly.

                <p>
                    With the core structure defined, I moved into rapid prototyping, creating a <strong>clickable Dutch-language prototype</strong>. My initial step involved informal "guerilla testing" with friends and family to quickly identify and address any basic interaction issues or navigational confusion. A crucial aspect of our approach involved empowering stakeholders: I developed a detailed usability script and then led a <strong>roleplay-based workshop</strong> designed to train our non-design colleagues on effectively conducting usability tests with seniors. This not only scaled our research efforts but also fostered a shared understanding of user needs.

                <p>
                    Armed with the training and scripts, our stakeholders then facilitated actual usability tests with geriatric patients. These sessions were conducted either <strong>face-to-face or via video calls</strong>, ensuring accessibility for a diverse group of participants. Based on the invaluable feedback gathered, we iteratively refined the prototype. Key improvements included: clarifying instructions, adding reassuring microcopy to build user confidence, and introducing a clear, intuitive <strong>visual progress indicator</strong> to help users understand their current position and overall completion within the multi-step grip strength test.
