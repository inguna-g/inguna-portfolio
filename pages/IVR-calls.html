  <h2>Tl;Dr</h2>
  <p>
    I led a comprehensive optimization project for our Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. This involved <strong>auditing a year's worth of customer call data</strong>, conducting <strong>stakeholder interviews</strong>, and implementing a rigorous <strong>pre- and post-testing methodology</strong> using closed card sorting in Treejack. The validated solution not only streamlined the IVR structure but also achieved an outstanding <strong>64% reduction in incorrectly placed calls</strong>, significantly reducing overhead for our call center's technical support team and improving customer satisfaction.

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    
    <div class="story-block">
        <div>
            <h3>Uncovering the Hidden Problem</h3>
            <p>The impetus for this project came directly from our business analysts and call center management. They reported a critical and costly issue: an alarmingly high volume of misrouted calls. Specifically, <strong>approximately one-third of calls routed to "technical issues" within the IVR had nothing to do with actual technical problems.</strong> This created significant overhead for our technical support operators, increasing wait times and frustrating customers who were not reaching the correct department.</p>
            <p>Our primary goal was clear: redefine the IVR options to better align with user needs, thereby reducing misrouted calls and improving the efficiency of our call center operations. A key insight (and spoiler alert!) emerged early on: the separation of billing information into a different, less obvious phone number was a major contributor to this misrouting, often pushing users into the "technical issues" queue out of frustration or lack of a better option.</p>
            <p>As part of a three-person design team, I was actively involved in every phase of this project, ensuring a user-centric approach informed all decisions. We benefited immensely from detailed call data provided by our key stakeholder, including key user scenarios already categorized. This allowed us to understand <strong>why</strong> people were calling without the need for extensive primary data collection at the outset.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Phase 1: Existing IVR Tree Analysis & Data Mapping</h3>
            <p>Our first phase focused on a deep dive into the existing IVR option tree. This involved a comprehensive <strong>content analysis of the current IVR script</strong>, a <strong>competitor analysis</strong> to understand industry best practices, and a thorough review of <strong>quantitative data</strong> on call reasons and topics. We meticulously mapped the <em>actual theme</em> of phone conversations to the <em>IVR option the user initially chose</em>, allowing us to identify precise patterns in the discrepancies and understand where users were consistently going wrong.</p>

            <h3>Phase 2: Benchmarking the Current IVR with Treejack</h3>
            <p>To establish a clear baseline for comparison and validate our future solution, the second phase involved creating a <strong>benchmark test for the current IVR structure using a closed card sorting study in Treejack.</strong> This was a critical step, as it provided quantifiable evidence of the current system's usability. <strong>The entire setup of this Treejack study, including writing survey questions and preparing the card sorting task, was my direct responsibility.</strong> We also focused on validating this test to ensure its reliability for the subsequent testing of our proposed solution.</p>
            <p>Throughout these initial phases, we maintained an <strong>open line of communication with our colleagues from the call center.</strong> Their insights were invaluable, not only in understanding daily operational challenges but also in capturing their specific requirements that absolutely had to be accommodated in the final IVR tree proposal. This collaborative approach ensured our research was grounded in real-world needs.</p>

            <h3>Phase 3: Designing & Validating the Optimized IVR</h3>
            <p>The third phase was dedicated to designing what we aimed to be the "perfect" IVR tree. This involved several key changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Renaming ambiguous categories</strong> to be more intuitive.</li>
                <li><strong>Consolidating redundant categories</strong> to simplify choices.</li>
                <li><strong>Introducing new categories</strong> to better align with common user needs (e.g., more clear billing options).</li>
                <li><strong>Optimizing the sequence</strong> in which options appeared in the IVR for better flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We then rigorously <strong>tested this proposed solution, again using closed card sorting tasks in Treejack.</strong> The card sorting task itself was a complex balancing act: we needed to ensure its length and complexity didn't compromise the validity of the results due to participant cognitive fatigue, while still capturing enough detail to be actionable. Through careful design, we managed to achieve this balance.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, we had a <strong>validated proposal</strong> that demonstrated clear improvements in user navigation. We presented these findings and the refined IVR structure to our stakeholders, detailing the expected improvements.</p>
