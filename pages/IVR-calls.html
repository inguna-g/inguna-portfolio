  <h2 tabindex="0">Tl;Dr</h2>
  <p>I led a comprehensive optimization project for our Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. This involved <strong>auditing a year's worth of customer call data</strong>, conducting <strong>stakeholder interviews</strong>, and implementing a rigorous <strong>pre- and post-testing methodology</strong> using closed card sorting in Treejack.</p>
    <p>The validated solution achieved an estimated <strong>~30% reduction in incorrectly placed calls</strong>, significantly reducing overhead for our call center's technical support team and improving customer satisfaction. </p>

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    
    <div class="story-block">
        <div>
            <h3 tabindex="0">Uncovering the Hidden Problem</h3>
            <p>Business analysts and call center management identified a critical, costly issue: one-third of calls routed to "technical issues" were actually about something else. This led to increased wait times and frustrated customers.</p>
            <p>Our goal was clear: redefine IVR options to reduce misrouted calls and boost call center efficiency. We quickly realized a key culprit was billing information being on a separate, less obvious number.</p>
            <p>As part of a three-person design team, I lead the testing and validation process, and presented the results to stakeholders.</p>

            <h3 tabindex="0">Phase 1: Existing IVR Tree Analysis & Data Mapping</h3>
            <p>I conducted a deep dive into the current IVR, including content analysis of scripts, competitor benchmarks, and a thorough review of quantitative call data.</p>

            <h3 tabindex="0">Phase 2: Benchmarking the Current IVR with Treejack</h3>
            <p>I designed and set up the entire Treejack study to benchmark the current IVR structure using a closed card sorting methodology. This included writing survey questions and preparing the card sorting task.</p>
            <p>I collaborated closely with call center colleagues to integrate their insights and operational requirements into our research.</p>

            <h3 tabindex="0">Phase 3: Designing & Validating the Optimized IVR</h3>
            <p>I contributed to designing the "perfect" IVR tree by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Renaming ambiguous categories for intuition</li>
                <li>Consolidating redundant options for simplicity.</li>
                <li>Introducing new, user-centric categories (e.g., clear billing options).</li>
                <li>Optimizing the sequence of options for a better flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My team and I rigorously tested this proposed solution using closed card sorting in Treejack, balancing task complexity with result validity.</p>
            <p>I presented validated findings and the refined IVR structure to stakeholders, detailing expected improvements.</p>
