        <section>
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>UniWeb, my employer, had an existing Electronic Data Capture (EDC) platform that was custom-built for a long-term client, <a href="https://www.dice-cro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DICE-CRO</a> (a data investigation company specializing in clinical trials). Our leadership envisioned a new, scalable SaaS-based EDC system that would propel UniWeb to new heights in the clinical trial market. This initiative aimed to transform a bespoke solution into a reusable, cutting-edge product.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>As the first and sole UX designer on this ambitious project, I spearheaded the design efforts for approximately one year. My responsibilities encompassed the entire UX lifecycle, from initial concept to detailed prototyping. I focused on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requirement Gathering:</strong> Collaborating to define the core needs for the new SaaS platform.</li>
                <li><strong>Use-Case Diagramming:</strong> Translating complex clinical trial workflows into clear use-case diagrams.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Prototyping:</strong> Creating comprehensive and fully interactive prototypes using Axure RP 8.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Ensuring all design and research documentation adhered to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), crucial for the regulated clinical trials environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Guerrilla Testing:</strong> Conducting rapid, informal usability tests on various parts of the prototypes to gather immediate feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Design System Development:</strong> Simultaneously building a robust design system, primarily based on Google Material Design, which was a specific mandate from leadership. This choice proved beneficial given the form-heavy nature of EDC systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Key Features of the EDC Platform</h2>
            <p>The SaaS EDC system was designed to be a comprehensive solution for managing clinical trial data, featuring:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Entry:</strong> Real-time validation, dynamic visits, fields, and forms.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Full and partial (targeted approach) source data verification.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Review:</strong> Capability to generate queries and access a range of default reports.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> Generated customized clinical data sets.</li>
                <li><strong>Administration:</strong> Robust user and site management, trial configuration, and user permissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Audit Trail:</strong> A full audit trail for both subject and non-subject data, ensuring compliance and data integrity.</li>
                <li><strong>Randomization</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Double Data Entry</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Training</strong> modules.</li>
                <li><strong>Subject PDF generation</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Approach & Challenges</h2>
            <p>This project was an internal initiative, which meant it often took a backseat to work for paying customers. Despite these prioritization challenges, I remained committed to delivering a high-quality product. The usability of the system was paramount, as the validity and integrity of clinical trial data literally depended on it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Outcome & Impact (Unlaunched)</h2>
            <p>I transitioned from UniWeb before the SaaS EDC platform was officially launched, and to my knowledge, it never went live. However, the design work was completed with clear objectives in mind:</p>
            <div class="result">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improved Data Entry Speed:</strong> Streamlining workflows and reducing friction for users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased User Satisfaction:</strong> Creating an intuitive and less error-prone experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Errors and Re-work:</strong> Enhancing data quality and operational efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Reusability:</strong> Designing the platform to require little or no custom coding for each new clinical trial instance, significantly cutting down deployment time and costs.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Although the project's ultimate fate is unknown to me, I am proud of the foundational UX work that set the stage for a potentially transformative product in the clinical trials space, emphasizing usability and data integrity above all.</p>
