    <h2>Tl;Dr</h2>
    <p>
      A UX optimization of the signup flow for broadband plans reduced drop-off by 9% and decreased support requests. Optimizing this flow was a long-term focus for me as part of the UX Research team.

      <div>
        <h3>Continuous monitoring of KPI's</h3>
        <p>At least once every quarter we held meetings with stakeholders to determine what changes needed to be implemented in the sign-up flow next. <br>The product was dynamically evolving: adding bundles, legal changes, price, availability, and service type were all subject to change. <br>Our goal was to ensure changes were implemented in a way that would lead to decreased customer drop-off.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Usability tests</h3>
        <p>For each iteration, we completed a full usability research cycle. From interactive prototypes, defining questions, recruiting participants, to analyzing results and presenting actionable suggestions for the next design iteration. </p>

        <h3>Results varied</h3>
        <p>Considering it was an ongoing project, the results varied each cycle. Our aim was to keep the most important customer signup flow performing at full capacity.
            <br>Our best results showed a decrease in abandonment, a drop in related support calls, and improved NPS scores.
